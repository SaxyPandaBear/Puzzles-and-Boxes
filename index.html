<h2>Puzzles and Boxes</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Get the special block through to the exit before time runs out.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This is a puzzle game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This game prototype is to evaluate more refined user input, as well as a more creative use of collision between objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
What are the unique aspects of your game that set it apart?
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
If the game has a story, summarize it in a paragraph. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players that this game is targeted towards are people who like puzzle games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I believe that this will be based mostly on trial and error, in finding the correct positions needed for the goal block to make it to the exit.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
    This game most closely resembles a sliding block game I used to play on my phone back in the day, but I don't remember the name of it. Regardless, there are many games like it out there that have the same gist and purpose.
